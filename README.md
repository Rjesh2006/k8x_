# 🔷 Kubernetes Cluster Architecture: Deep Structure

## 🔷 KUBERNETES CLUSTER

### 🧠 CONTROL PLANE (Master Node)
- **📡 API Server**
  - **Handles Requests:** All user and system requests go through the API server (via `kubectl` or other clients).
  - **Authentication/Authorization:** Validates and checks permissions before processing.
  - **Serves the Cluster State:** Exposes a RESTful API for interaction.
  - **Communicates with etcd, Scheduler, Controller Manager.**
  
- **🧾 etcd (Key-Value Database)**
  - **Stores Cluster Data:** Saves all data like cluster state, secrets, configuration, etc.
  - **Highly Available & Distributed:** Data is stored redundantly to avoid data loss.
  - **Critical for Cluster Recovery:** Can recover lost state or configuration during failures.
  - **Interacts with API Server:** Holds and provides data when needed.
  
- **🎯 Scheduler**
  - **Assigns Pods to Nodes:** The scheduler looks at available nodes and assigns pods based on resource needs, constraints, etc.
  - **Makes Smart Decisions:** Uses multiple factors to decide the best node (e.g., CPU, memory, affinity rules, taints, tolerations).
  - **Communicates with Kubelet:** Instructs Kubelet to schedule pods onto nodes.
  - **Interacts with API Server & Controller Manager.**
  
- **🛡️ Controller Manager**
  - **Maintains Cluster State:** Ensures the current state of the cluster matches the desired state.
  - **Control Loops:** Runs several control loops like ReplicaSet (ensures correct number of pods), Node (ensures nodes are healthy), Endpoints, etc.
  - **Communication:** Works closely with the API Server and Scheduler to keep the cluster healthy.
  - **Handles Failures:** Ensures new Pods are created if desired replicas are missing, or if Pods fail.
  - **Example Controllers:**
    - **ReplicaSet Controller:** Ensures the desired number of pods is maintained.
    - **Deployment Controller:** Manages rolling updates and rollbacks.

- **☁️ Cloud Controller Manager (optional)**
  - **Integrates with Cloud Providers:** Manages cloud-specific resources (e.g., load balancers, storage, VM instances).
  - **Handles Node Lifecycle:** Manages node addition/removal based on cloud resources.
  - **Interacts with External Cloud Services:** Manages external IPs, volumes, etc.

### 🔨 WORKER NODES
- **📦 Kubelet**
  - **Pod Lifecycle Management:** Kubelet ensures that the containers inside a Pod are running and healthy.
  - **Communication with API Server:** It regularly checks with the API server for pod updates and reports node status.
  - **Pod-to-Container Communication:** Ensures that containers inside Pods are running, restarted if they fail, and report back health statuses.
  - **Manages Configurations:** Configures pods with environment variables, secrets, and config maps.
  
- **🌐 Kube-proxy**
  - **Service Networking:** Kube-proxy ensures that network traffic is correctly routed to Pods, whether internally or externally.
  - **Load Balancing:** Routes traffic to multiple Pods in a service, balancing the load across all available Pods.
  - **Service Discovery:** Helps in discovering services inside the cluster using ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer.
  - **IP Tables:** Uses iptables or IPVS to route traffic to Pods based on their IP addresses and port.
  
- **🧱 Container Runtime**
  - **Container Management:** Runs and manages the lifecycle of containers (Docker, containerd, or CRI-O).
  - **Container Isolation:** Ensures that containers are isolated from each other but can communicate if required.
  - **Pod Initialization:** Creates and manages containers as defined in Pods.
  - **Supports Image Pulling:** Downloads and runs container images (Docker, containerd) from repositories (DockerHub, private registry).
  
- **🚀 Pods**
  - **🐳 Containers**
    - **Runs the Application:** The container holds the application code, libraries, and runtime environment.
    - **Runs with Images:** Containers are instantiated from container images (e.g., Nginx, Redis, Java app).
    - **Network & Storage:** Containers within a pod share networking (localhost) and storage (volumes).
  
  - **📥 Container Images**
    - **Blueprints for Containers:** Pre-packaged software including the app and all dependencies (e.g., Nginx image, Node.js app image).
    - **Hosted on Registries:** Images are fetched from registries like DockerHub, GCR, or private registries.
    - **Immutable:** Once built, images are immutable and cannot be changed.

## 📌 Summary of Key Interactions:
1. **API Server:** The entry point for all interactions. Requests come through the API Server and it talks to **etcd** for storage.
2. **etcd:** Holds all the cluster data and state, crucial for restoring or scaling the system.
3. **Scheduler:** Decides which nodes should run which pods based on the available resources and constraints.
4. **Controller Manager:** Ensures the desired state is maintained (e.g., if a pod dies, it’s automatically replaced).
5. **Kubelet:** Manages the lifecycle of pods on a worker node, ensuring they are healthy and running.
6. **Kube-proxy:** Ensures proper networking for services and routes requests to the right pod.
